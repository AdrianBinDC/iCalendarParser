A [RFC 5545](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5545.txt) compatible parser for iCalendar files in Swift.

## Installation

To use `iCalendarParser` just add it as Swift Package Manager dependency:

### via Xcode

Open your project, click on File â†’ Add Packages, enter the repository URL (`https://github.com/dmail-me/iCalendarParser.git`), and add the package product to your app target.

### via SPM Package.swift

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(
      name: "iCalendarParser",
      url: "https://github.com/dmail-me/iCalendarParser",
      from: "0.1.0"
    )
]
```

## Usage

To get started with iCalendarParser, all you have to do is to import it and use its `ICParser` type to convert any ICS file into iCalendar object:

```swift
import iCalendarParser

let rawICS: String = ...
let parser = ICParser()
let calendar: ICalendar? = parser.calendar(from: rawICS)
```

## Is it production ready?

iCalendarParser is currently not feature complete yet. While it requires an additional implementation to be fully compatible with RFC5545, we appreciate contributions from the community to help us improve the library. 

However, it's worth noting that the library is being used in production within the [Dmail.me app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dmail-me-dm-the-world/id6444334972), and we are committed to constantly improving it.

## TODO

- Parse To-Do, Journal, Free/Busy, and Alarm components
- Add additional properties in `ICEvent`
